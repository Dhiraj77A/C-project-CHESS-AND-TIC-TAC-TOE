# 🎮 Classical Games in C++: Tic Tac Toe & Chess

Welcome to the **Classical Game Suite**, a C++ project featuring two timeless board games: **Tic Tac Toe** and **Chess**. This project is a demonstration of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++, combined with a **simple graphical user interface (GUI)** using **SFML**. Users can choose which game to play through a game launcher menu on startup.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was created to:
- Practice and demonstrate object-oriented programming in C++
- Learn GUI programming using SFML
- Build fully functional board games with clear game rules
- Create a game launcher interface to choose between games

Both games are interactive and include visual feedback using mouse input.

## 🎯 Features

### 🕹 Game Launcher
- Clean and user-friendly **startup menu**
- Lets the player choose between:
  - `Play Tic Tac Toe`
  - `Play Chess`

### ✅ Tic Tac Toe
- 3x3 graphical grid
- Two-player gameplay (no AI)
- Detects win, draw, and invalid moves
- Mouse click-based interaction

### ♟ Chess
- Standard 8x8 board layout
- Implements complete chess rules:
  - Castling
  - En passant
  - Pawn promotion
  - Check, checkmate, and stalemate
- Turn-based gameplay with GUI interaction
- Move validation and rule enforcement

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **C++17**
- **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**:
  - Graphics
  - Window & Event handling
- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Class hierarchies for game objects
